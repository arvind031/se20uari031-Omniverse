## Interior Kitchen 3D Asset Using Blender

This project involves creating a 3D model of a kitchen interior using Blender. The model includes objects such as a dining table, cupboards, sink, and a refrigerator.

### Usecase

In this scenario, the refrigerator is equipped with IoT sensors that enhance its functionality and provide valuable features for users. These sensors include:

1. **Temperature Sensors:**
   - Temperator sensor which continously monitor the internal temperature which alert the user in case of temperature fluctuations.

2. **Energy Sensors:**
   - Energy Sensors: They detect the consumption of energy by the refrigerator.

3. **Safety and Security Sensors:**
   - They help in smoke detection, carbon monoxide detection and notify the users in case of emergency.
